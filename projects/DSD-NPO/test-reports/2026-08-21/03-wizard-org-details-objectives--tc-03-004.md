# Report: TC-03-004 and TC-05-013 — the two smoke cases that were never actually exercised

**Date:** 2026-08-21 06:40 UTC
**Plan:** test-plans/npo-registration/03-wizard-org-details-objectives.md
**Execution Mode:** ai-driven (Playwright MCP, live QA public portal)
**Result:** PARTIAL — **TC-03-004 PASSES**; **TC-05-013 NOT RUN**, blocked by a **Critical data-loss defect found during setup**
**Duration:** ~1450s
**Cases:** TC-03-004, TC-05-013
**Environment:** QA · public portal, signed in · view mode **Latest**

## Why this run
Both cases appeared in an earlier run's `Cases:` header but their assertions were never exercised — the reason smoke
read 68/70 when it is 66/70. This run executes them properly.

## Summary
| Case | ADO | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **TC-03-004** Legal Form 'NPC' reveals the CIPC Registration Number field | #101628 | ✅ **PASS** |
| **TC-05-013** Declaration auto-populates Organisation Name and Date | #101689 | ⛔ **NOT RUN** — blocked, see below |

---

## ✅ TC-03-004 — PASS
Run on draft **APPL26-00793**, Tab 2 *Organisation Details*.

| # | Assertion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **(BLOCKING)** The CIPC Registration Number field appears when Legal Form = NPC | ✅ **PASS** |
| 2 | It is marked required (`.ant-form-item-required`) | ✅ **PASS** |

**Baseline first:** with Legal Form = `Voluntary Association`, the string "CIPC" appears nowhere and the form shows 24
labelled fields.

**On selecting `NPC`:** a field appears labelled **`NPCRegistration No *`**, carrying `ant-form-item-required`, with
placeholder **`YYYY/######/##`** — the CIPC registration-number format. Entering `2026/123456/08` enabled `Next`,
which had been disabled while the field was empty. Reverting to `Voluntary Association` hid the field again and
restored `Membership`.

⇒ The conditional is fully wired: reveal, required-marking, and gating all behave as FDS 7.5.1 rule 3a prescribes.

### 🔑 A trap that nearly produced a false FAIL
My first DOM sweep reported *no* CIPC field and I was about to record a FAIL. There are **two `NPCRegistration No`
form items in the DOM**:

| Instance | `display` | Label class |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `none` | `ant-form-item-required-mark-optional` (**optional**) |
| 1 | `block` | `ant-form-item-required` (**required**) — the live one |

I had inspected instance 0. This is the `hidden controls are mounted` gotcha already recorded in CLAUDE.md, now with a
second instance. **Enumerate visible items and re-read after the trigger; never conclude from the first match.**

### Divergences worth reporting (not defects)
- The field is labelled **`NPCRegistration No`**; ADO #101628 and FDS 7.5.1 rule 3a call it **"CIPC Registration
  Number"**. Same concept, different wording — worth aligning the case or the label.
- Selecting `NPC` also **removes the `Membership *` field**. Not mentioned in the case; recorded as an observation.
- The stored value **persists after the trigger is reverted**: after switching back to `Voluntary Association` the NPO
  record still holds `npcRegistrationNo: "2026/123456/08"`. Same shape as the deregistration donate-assets flag found
  on 08-20 — a hidden conditional keeps its value.

---

## ⛔ TC-05-013 — NOT RUN, and why
The case asserts that the **Declaration** tab auto-populates *Organisation Name* and *Application Date* and that both
are read-only. Reaching Declaration means passing Tab 4, which enforces **"A minimum of 3 Office Bearers to be
captured"** before `Next` enables.

The draft held 2 office bearers at the end of the 08-20 session. Today it held **0**, and while rebuilding them I
found the reason — a **Critical data-loss defect**:

> **Navigating back to Organisation Details and forward again deletes every office bearer on the draft.**
> `bugs/2026-08-21-returning-to-organisation-details-deletes-all-office-bearers.md`

Reproduced twice, with the grid and the API agreeing at every step:

| Run | Office bearers before | Action | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | 1 (grid + API) | Back ×2 → change Legal Form NPC and back → Next ×2 | **0** |
| B (control) | 1 (grid + API) | Back ×2 → **change nothing** → Next ×2 | **0** |

Run B rules out the Legal Form change; the **Back → Next round trip alone** is sufficient. This also explains the two
office bearers that disappeared from this draft overnight — they were destroyed by my own first `Next` on
Organisation Details this morning, not by anything external.

### 🔑 Correction to my own method
When I first saw the empty grid I could not attribute it, because my first look at Tab 4 today came **after** I had
already edited Organisation Details — I had no clean "before" reading. The controlled runs above were needed to say
anything at all. **Observe the state you intend to reason about before you change anything upstream of it.**

### What TC-05-013 needs
It is reachable, but only on a **forward-only pass**: capture all 3 office bearers in a single visit to Tab 4, never
stepping back, then complete *Admin & Operations* and *Documents* (which require uploads) to reach *Declaration*.
That was not attempted in this run. It is a meaningful amount of setup, and it is worth deciding whether to spend it
before or after the data-loss defect is fixed — with the defect present, any mistake on an earlier tab costs the
whole office-bearer set.

## Records touched
| Record | State left |
|---|---|
| `APPL26-00793` draft | Legal Form restored to **Voluntary Association**; `npcRegistrationNo` **left populated** (`2026/123456/08`) — the field is hidden and offers no way to clear it |
| Office bearers on that draft | **0** — three were created during this run (`Thabo Mahlangu`, `Naledi Sithole` (unsaved), `Sipho Nkosi`) and destroyed by the defect under test |

🔒 **POPIA:** every office bearer created in this run used the **passport** route with synthetic details, specifically
to avoid triggering the live DHA identity lookup. No real identities were read or transcribed.

## Effect on smoke coverage
- **TC-03-004** moves from *never exercised* to **PASS**.
- **TC-05-013** remains unverdicted. Smoke is therefore **67 of 70** verdicted, not 66 — and the one still outstanding
  is TC-05-013.
