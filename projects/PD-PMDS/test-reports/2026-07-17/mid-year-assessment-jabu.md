# PMDS SL 1-12 — Mid-Year Assessment happy path (Jabu Hadebe)

**Date:** 2026-07-17
**Cycle:** SL 1-12 Performance Agreement, FY2026/27 — **Mid Year Assessment** stage
**Employee:** Jabu Hadebe (`JabuH`), **Ref PR2026/7343**
**Result:** PASSED — full Mid-Year happy-path chain completed to **Completed / Awaiting PERSAL Sync**.
**App:** HCM Admin Portal (PMDS module), https://pd-hcm-adminportal-qa.shesha.app/ (QA)

## Purpose
Extend Mid-Year coverage to another of the Contracting-completed users with a clean happy path (no dispute), mirroring Simmy's run earlier today.

## Flow (3 participant steps)
1. **Employee Self-Assessment** (`JabuH`, `sagov-employee-complete-self-assessment v37`): 4 KRAs @25% (Handle client queries with courtesy & professionalism / Ensure accessible & consistent service delivery / Deliver value for money in daily tasks / Provide timely & reliable customer service), 2 key activities each (8 total). Every activity rated **3** (comment only, per the 3=comment / 1·2·4=comment+attachment rule). Page-level Employee Comments added → **Submit** → Draft → Review.
2. **Supervisor Review** (`LungileN`, `sagov-supervisor-review-performance-assessment v38`): Supervisor Score **3** on all 8 activities (matching → auto-agree). All 4 KRAs verified in the main table as **Own 3 / Supervisor 3 / Agreed 3** (no silent-drop this run). Page-level Supervisor Comments → **Sign** → Review → HR Review.
3. **HR Verify** (`GOV005` = Andrew Smith, `sagov-performancereview-verifyperformanceassessment`): Confirmation checkbox → **Verify** → **Completed / Awaiting PERSAL Sync**.

## Dashboard reconciliation (end of the 2026-07-17 batch)
- Mid Year Assessment: Total 41 · Not Started 37 · In progress 1 · **Completed 3** (Simmy + Sanele + Jabu). The 1 In progress = Lungile (self-assessment still Draft, not driven this batch).

## Notes
- Ref prefix **PR**; Mid-Year HR verifier = `GOV005` / `EMP001234` (not SalesHR).
- Score→% Own-column quirk and non-fatal `executeScriptSync` console noise as elsewhere.

## Environment
- Employee/supervisor pwd `123qwe`. Jabu's supervisor = `LungileN`. Mid-Year HR = `GOV005` (Andrew) / `EMP001234` (Sarah).
