# CLAUDE.md — Hybrid Markdown + Playwright Testing (Bid Management project)

> **Multi-project hub.** This file describes the **Bid Management** project. Shared Playwright + Allure infrastructure (`package.json`, `playwright.config.ts`, `node_modules/`, `scripts/run-plan.js`) lives at the hub root one level up. Tests run from the hub root: `node scripts/run-plan.js projects/bid-management/test-plans/<folder>/<plan>.md`.

This project uses **markdown plans as the source of truth** and **Playwright `.spec.ts` files as a derived runtime artefact**. Plans live in [test-plans/](test-plans/); each plan has a paired `.spec.ts` beside it that Playwright executes for speed. When a script step fails or hits a `TODO` marker, Claude falls back to AI-driven MCP browser execution, repairs the failing step in the spec, and re-runs.

> **The .md plan is canonical.** The .spec.ts is a generated, self-healing artefact. Edit the .md, not the spec — except for AI-repair patches, which Claude applies automatically.

## The skill chain

```
/test-setup   →   /CreateTest   →   /RunTest   →   /submit-test-results
                                         ↓
                                  /Run-test-remote   (optional, parallel branch)
```

## How It Works
0. **First time on a machine:** run `/test-setup` to install Node deps, Playwright browsers, verify Java/Allure, hub config, and (for CI) check `gh` CLI + GitHub secrets + Teams webhook. Idempotent.
1. `/CreateTest` writes BOTH `test-plans/<folder>/<name>.md` AND a paired `<name>.spec.ts`. Selectors are recorded live via Playwright MCP.
2. `/RunTest` runs Playwright first: `node ../../scripts/run-plan.js projects/bid-management/test-plans/<folder>/<name>.md` (from hub root).
3. If the spec passes → write the markdown report from Playwright's JSON output.
4. If a step fails → AI fallback patches the failing line in the .spec.ts and re-runs.
5. If AI fallback fails twice → auto-classify (stale-plan vs business-logic) and either fix the plan or log a bug.
6. Regenerate the project dashboard (the hub's `scripts/build-project-data.js --project=bid-management`) and the per-project Allure report.
7. `/submit-test-results` publishes to the central hub (this **is** the hub — that step is a no-op here, just a `git push`).

## Mandatory Pre-Flight
Before executing ANY test plan:
1. Read this file (`projects/bid-management/CLAUDE.md`) completely
2. Read [test-plans/RULES.md](test-plans/RULES.md) completely
3. Read the specific test plan file (`.md`)
4. Read the paired `.spec.ts` if it exists
5. Only then begin execution

## Test Artifacts (per-project)

| Artifact | Path (within this project) |
|---|---|
| **JUnit XML** | `test-results/junit.xml` |
| **Allure raw** | `allure-results/*.json` |
| **Allure report** | `allure-report/index.html` |
| **Playwright JSON** | `test-results/results.json` |
| **Run report** | `test-reports/YYYY-MM-DD/<name>.md` |
| **Bug log** | `test-reports/bugs/<name>.md` |
| **Screenshots / traces / videos** | `test-results/artifacts/` |

## Core Constraints
- **Plans are markdown.** `.md` files in [test-plans/](test-plans/) are canonical.
- **Specs are derived.** Don't hand-edit `.spec.ts` outside of AI-repair flow.
- **Playwright-first.** Always try the script before falling back to AI.
- **AI repair patches only the failing step.**
- **Always snapshot before AI repair edits.**
- **Fail fast on blockers.** A failed `(BLOCKING)` assertion stops the test.
- **Always render the Allure report after a run.**
